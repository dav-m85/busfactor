#busfactor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dav-m85/busfactor.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dav-m85/busfactor)

*busfactor* generates a coverage report indicating how much developers worked on each file of a git repo. It helps pinpoint part of the code that are poorly maintained / known by the teams working on it.

If someone get hit by a bus, maybe some files becomes difficult to maintain further.

It was inspired by a GoogleIO talk given by Brian Fitzpatrick, Ben Collins-Sussman, "The Myth of the Genius Programer".
